# What is this?
Chrome Extension built with just JS and HTML/CSS.

# Why?
Realized I frequently waste my time visiting certain websites when I'm working on other things on my laptop/desktop. Decided to hack a chrome extension to keep myself away from it, and thought it could be fun to make a chrome extension too.

# Disclaimer 
Hacked this thing during breaks between lectures for a few days. Just a hacky project, so code is quite spaghetti and the design is awful lol.
